                        through a link of sorts</p>

                        on the transceiver PCB and three GPIOs connected to a falling edge interrupt for the Allen Bradley buttons from the debouncing IC. One Project will be used for all nodes were the only the ID changes between nodes </p>

                        function to call the interrupt by checking which GPIO created the flag and then add the logic. Switch case is added to itterate between whcih button was pressed to detwrmin what the Tx Message is and a switch to read the Rx message.

                        Bradley. Upon inspection with the test message receiving, the other nodes are running off of the same ID as the Supervisory Controller. So by changing the ID, the floor node works as expected. This is a simple fix as it is a Proof
                        of Concept that our node code works, and will be using the proper ID's once the Finite State Machine logic is re designed on the RPi level.
